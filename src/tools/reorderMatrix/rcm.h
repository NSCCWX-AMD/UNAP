 * @file rcm.h
 *
 * Version 0.9.1. September 24, 2005.
 *
 * @section rcm-use How to use the reverse Cuthill-McKee package
 *
 * The main routine to call is @c genrcmi() (or @c genrcml() if you
 * use @c long integers to store your graph information).
 * The way @c genrcmi()/@c genrcml() works can be adjusted by setting
 * the @a flags parameter. In most cases the `default' behavior
 * will be just fine and the caller just sets @a flags to @c 0.
 * Specific flags can be set by using the constants defined in
 * @c rcm.h. Multiple flags are combined by binary or
 * (the `<tt>|</tt>' operator in C).
 * @n
 * The undirected graph @c genrcmi() should work on is passed
 * in the form of the three parameters @a n, @a xadj and @a adj.
 * The graph is expected to be stored in a compressed format
 * similar to the compressed sparse row/column formats for matrices.
 * @n
 * The main outputs is the new ordering of the nodes, to which the
 * graph should be permuted. Notice that the output is only this
 * new ordering. The graph, as passed in @a xadj and @a adj, is
 * not modified by @c genrcmi().
 * The new ordering is stored in the caller-provided vector @a perm,
 * i.e., @a perm[@a p] is the node to become node @a p after the
 * permutation is actually applied to the graph.
 * @n
 * Additionally two working arrays (@a mask and @a deg) are needed.
 *
 * On default, @c genrcmi()/@c genrcml() expects indices to be zero
 * based (as in C) and not one based (as in Fortran). This applies
 * to @a xadj, @a adj and @a mask on input (to @a mask on input only if
 * the  @c #RCM_USE_MASK flag is set) and to @a perm, @a mask and
 * @a deg on ouput. If your data is one based (like in Fortran),
 * set the @c #RCM_FORTRAN_INDICES flag.
 *
 * Further details can be found at the documentation for @c genrcmi().
 *
 *
 * @subsection call-sub Callable subroutines
 *
 * Additionally to @c genrcmi()/@c genrcml(), two subroutines
 * are declared non-@c static, i.e., can be used from outside of
 * @c rcm.c. For more details we refer to the linked detail
 * documentation of these functions.
 * @c fnrooti() finds a pseudo-peripheral node (starting at any
 * given node in the component) and @c rcmi() finds the
 * RCM ordering, based on a given root for the rooted level set
 * structure.

/**

 * The default is to use C style (zero based) indices.
 *
 * Fortran and C/C++ use different array indexing.
 * In Fortran indices are based on one, in C on zero.
 * This means the first element in an array has index 1 in Fortran
 * and index 0 in C.
 *
 * If the @c RCM_FORTRAN_INDICES flag is selected, an index 1 is
 * interpreted to point to the first element of an array.
 *
 * @remark
 * Internally all indices are zero based, as it is natural for
 * a C program. @c RCM_FORTRAN_INDICES covers only input/output
 * data. The use of pointer arithmetic (following the way
 * <a href="http://www.netlib.org/f2c/">f2c</a>
 * converts arrays from Fortran to C) allows the use of Fortran

 *
 * The main purpose of @c RCM_C_INDICES is to help writing

 * In the Cuthill-McKee algorithm we construct a level set by scanning
 * through the previous one. Adjacent nodes not yet used in this or any
 * prior level set are added to the new one. The nodes added from

/**
 * @def RCM_INSERTION_SORT
 * @brief Use linear insertion sort instead of heapsort.
 *
 * Changing the sorting routine does not only change the

 * This is due to the fact that heapsort is not stable,
 * i.e. nodes with the same degree may be exchanged by
 * heapsort. On the other hand insertion sort kepp such
 * nodes in their original order.
 * Heapsort was choosen as the default sorting algorithm
 * because it is much faster in the worst case and there
 * are also real word examples showing a significant
 * improvement in execution time over insertion sort.
 * Finding a (symmetric) RCM ordering of the
 * <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/~sdkamvar/research.html#Data"
 * >Stanford Web Matrix</a> is more than 15 times
 * faster if heapsort is used instead of insertion sort.
 *
 * The SPARSPAK implementation of RCM uses linear insertion sort
 * and hence the @c RCM_INSERTION_FLAG can be used to get the exact
 * same permutation SPARSPAK would find. This is mostly useful
 * for the purpose of testing and comparison.

     *               If the flag @c #RCM_USE_MASK is set, a slightly
